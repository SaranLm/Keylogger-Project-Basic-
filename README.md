ðŸ“Œ What is a Keylogger?
A Keylogger is a software tool that records keystrokes made by a user on a keyboard. Ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals use keyloggers for security audits, parental monitoring, or testing system vulnerabilities. However, malicious use of keyloggers is illegal.




ðŸ›  How Does It Work?
=> Captures keystrokes: Monitors and records each key pressed.

=> logs: Saves keystrokes in a file or sends them to an email/server.

=> Runs in the background: Works silently without the user's knowledge (for ethical testing only).

=> Can log timestamps: Records when each keystroke was made.
